In 2021 the Association of Research Libraries and six academic institutions involved in the Data Curation Network (DCN) were awarded a [US National Science Foundation (NSF) EAGER grant (#2135874)](https://www.arl.org/research-data/rads-initiative-phase-1/) to conduct research, develop models, and collect costing information for public access to research data across five disciplinary areas: environmental science, materials science, psychology, biomedical sciences, and physics.
