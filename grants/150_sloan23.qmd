I represented Duke Libraries in this nine month project designed to explore ["the details, potential strategies, benefits, and barriers to creating a sustainable data science consulting service within an academic environment"](https://datascienceacademy.ncsu.edu/data-science-consulting/ds-consulting-highed-workshop/). The project brought together a diverse community of faculty, staff, and students focused on improving academic data science services with a special focus on inclusivity, outreach, and sustainability. I enjoyed working with a multi-institutional team on a [publication](10.1002/sta4.644) that represents our efforts on this Sloan funded workshop.
